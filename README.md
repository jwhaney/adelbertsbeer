## This map is no longer used by Adelbert's due to the brewery no longer being in business :worried:
## You can still view it through my github pages site

This is a web map I created for Adelbert's Brewery in Austin, TX. The map displays counties across the U.S. where Adelbert's beer is sold. The counties are symbolized by each Distributor that sells the delicious beer. This map was developed using Leaflet.js and various plugins including Esri's geocoder.

~You can also access the map directly from Adelbert's website at http://adelbertsbeer.com/ and then selecting Visit - Find Our Beer from the menu.~
